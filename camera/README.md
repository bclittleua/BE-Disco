This python3.4+ script operates in conjunction with Motion for linux/mac (https://motion-project.github.io/). 

Example motion config included.

Motion is very useful but I don't know of a windows varitant. However, windows users can try WSL2, which is a linux kernal that runs on top of windows, no stupid dual booting required! For details on WSL2: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install


Per motion.conf, hook.py is triggered by on_event_start and on_movie/end.
