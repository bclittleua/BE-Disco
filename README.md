# SEA-BE-22
This repo contains several single-purpose examples of bots to run on a Discord server. You can and should combine all of the functions you desire into a single bot, but I separate them here for the sake of clarity.

## Step 0: Getting Started
- **[Instructions](/instructions)**
  - How to install Python and other dependencies for the projects in this repo. 

## Step 1: The Backbone
- **[Hook](/hook)**
  - NOT a bot, but the first step in making a bot interactive. 
 
## Step 2: The Muscles
 - **[Logviewer](/logviewer)** 
   - This bot runs a script, reads data from a log, and returns it to chat.

## On your own
- **[Camera](/camera)** 
  - This bot is for posting images and video from a live camera. Ideal for lab or security setups.
  - 
- **[Music](/music)** 
  - This bot will play requested music in a voice channel.

<!--
- **pir**
  - utilizes a cheap PIR sensor and a raspberry pi to detect motion and updates bot status accordingly
- **reactor** 
  - this bot will assign roles in a discord channel based on your reactions
- **steamer** 
  - this bot queries live stats from a specified steam game server and shows player count in status
- **the_kitchen_skink**
  -  most of the above foolishly combined into a single bot
