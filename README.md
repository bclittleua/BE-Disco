# SEA-BE-22
This repo contains several single-purpose examples of bots to run on a Discord server. You can and should combine all of the functions you desire into a single bot, but I separate them here for the sake of clarity.

- **camera** 
  - this bot is for posting images and video from a live camera. ideal for lab or security setups.
- **music** 
  - this bot will play requested music in a voice channel
<!--
- **logview** 
  - this bot reads data from a log and returns it to chat
- **sc_runner** 
  - this bot will run a script from a predefined directory
- **reactor** 
  - this bot will assign roles in a discord channel based on your reactions
- **steamer** 
  - this bot queries live stats from a specified steam game server and shows player count in status
- **the kitchen skink**
  -  all of the above foolishly combined into a single bot
-->

- **instructions**
  - how to install python and other dependencies for the projects in this repo
