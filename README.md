# SEA-BE-22
This repo contains several single-purpose examples of bots to run on a Discord server. You can and should combine all of the functions you desire into a single bot, but I separate them here for the sake of clarity.

## Step 0: Getting Started
- **Instructions**
  - how to install python and other dependencies for the projects in this repo 

## Step 1: The Backbone
- **Hook**
  - NOT a bot, but the first step in making a bot interactive. 
## Step 2: The Muscles
 - **Logviewer** 
     - This bot reads data from a log and returns it to chat.
- **Sc_runner** 
    - This bot will run a script from a predefined directory.

## Step 3: The Senses
- **Camera** 
  - This bot is for posting images and video from a live camera. Ideal for lab or security setups.

## On your own
- **Music** 
  - This bot will play requested music in a voice channel.
<!--
- **reactor** 
  - this bot will assign roles in a discord channel based on your reactions
- **steamer** 
  - this bot queries live stats from a specified steam game server and shows player count in status
- **the_kitchen_skink**
  -  most of the above foolishly combined into a single bot
